/*
    Higher order components is a design pattern in react that is used due to providing 
    reusability to the code. It competes with the render props pattern. 

    In this pattern, a function accepts a component as a parameter, and returns a new, 
    improved component. This function will provide the properties and functionalities 
    that are to be shared between the different component types, such as the constructor and
    some functions.
