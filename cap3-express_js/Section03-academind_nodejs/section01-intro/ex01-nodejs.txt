NodeJS => A javascript runtime that allows javascript to be run outside the browser.
NodeJS uses the V8 engine developed by google and also used on google chrome.
The V8 engine compiles the javascript code to machine code.
Adds features such as access to file system, and other features restricted in browser JS.

* In nodeJS we create the server itself. For instance, in PHP we don't create the server, 
we use Apache or Nginx.
