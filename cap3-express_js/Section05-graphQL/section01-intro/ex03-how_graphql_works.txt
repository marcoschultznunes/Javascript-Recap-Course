GraphQL Query:

    Is composed of the following nested objects

    Operation Types:
        query = GET
        mutation = POST, UPDATE & DELETE
        subscription = Websockets

    Endpoint:
        users, products, posts, etc.

    Attributes:
        id, name, description, price, etc.


    ex:
        query {
            products {
                description
                price
            }
        }

=> GraphQL uses type definition, defining the data types of our attributes.

=> Resolvers: Are functions which behave like controllers, defining how the server should 
respond to each query.
