Install on each of the 3 services independently:
    npm install --save express
    npm install --save body-parser
    npm install --save mongoose

mLab:
    Cloud platform to host MongoDB databases

mLab does not exist anymore. It has migrated to Mongo Atlas.

You can signup with mLab which will redirect to Mongo Atlas.

You can create a cluster, then a user, then a database and then more users through Mongo Atlas

I will use just a single cluster with the 3 databases.
