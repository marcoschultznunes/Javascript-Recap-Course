A 304 Not Modified message is an HTTP response status code indicating that the requested 
resource has not been modified since the previous transmission, 
so there is no need to retransmit the requested resource to the client. 
In effect, a 304 Not Modified response code acts as an implicit redirection to a 
cached version of the requested resource.
