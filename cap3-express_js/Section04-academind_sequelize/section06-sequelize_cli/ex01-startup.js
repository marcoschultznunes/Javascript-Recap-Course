/*
    It is now part 2 of the sequelize course. Now we will learn how to use sequelize in a 
    different, more organized way, using sequelize cli and ES6 classes.
    
    The sequelize cli is similar to PHP artisan, and now we are going to have migrations and
    seeders in our project.
*/

/*
    We'll now use the cli_classes_project, we'll start by doing npm init -y, then installing 
    sequelize and mysql2, and then installing sequelize-cli GLOBALLY (otherwise there will not 
    be accessto the commands on the terminal):
        npm install --g --save sequelize-cli
*/

/*
    We can now use the command
        sequelize init

    to create a few folders and files automatically to setup our sequelize project.
