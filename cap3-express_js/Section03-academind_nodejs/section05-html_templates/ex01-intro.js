/*
    This section will solely focus on introducing html templating in Node JS. So no Database
or JSON file with data will be used.

    The 3 most popular template engines with NodeJS are:

    Pug(formerly Jade) => Uses a simplified syntax of HTML, which means that HTML code does
not directly translate to the template engine, which is why we won't use it;

    Handlebars => This one translates HTML, but it does not have as many features as the 
next one, which is why we won't use it;

    EJS => Translates to HTML and it has a good amount of features, so this will be the used
one.

    To start off, we'll use the previous section's project, so we don't have to write an 
app from scratch for this section in particular
