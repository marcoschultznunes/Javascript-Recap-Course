GraphQL API => A graphQL API is just like a rest API, it is stateless, client independent, and 
it exchanges data. The difference is that graphQL allows us more flexibility when querying.

With REST APIs, the frontend always fetches the specific data that an endpoint provides, this 
means that if we want to control which attributes of an entity we want to fetch, we have to make
more endpoints, or complicate the already existing ones. With graphQL, that problem is solved,
we can specify which attributes we want to fetch in the frontend.

=> A graphQL API has just a single endpoint: 

    POST /graphql

This means that we always use POST, even for fetching data. The request body we send will be
the object that defines the query.
