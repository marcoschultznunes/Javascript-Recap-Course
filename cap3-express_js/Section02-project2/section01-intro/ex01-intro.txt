This course is based on Academind's Building a RESTful API with Node.js.

The previous course was more of an introduction designed to explain the microsservices 
architecture. This new one will improve the sophistication of the back-end, with better folder
structures, error handling, etc.

This will not be a microsservices system, but in the next project, i will refactor this one to
become a microsservices back-end.
