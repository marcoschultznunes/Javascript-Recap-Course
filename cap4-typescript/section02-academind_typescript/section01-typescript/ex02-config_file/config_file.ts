    To add a config file to your typescript project: 
        tsc --init

    A tsconfig.json file will be created.

/*
    With a tsconfig file we now must run 
        tsc

    to compile all typescipt files in the folder to javascript. If we do tsc to a single file 
    like we've been doing before, the new configurations will be ignored!

    Note: by default TS compiles to ES5
