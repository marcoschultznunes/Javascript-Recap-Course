A strategy to deal with adding overflow-y: scroll to a side menu with a close button with 
everything having absolute position, is to separate the side menu head and side menu body in
2 divs, each with its own class. The side menu head will contain the close button, the side menu
body will allow the rest of the menu to be scrolled.
