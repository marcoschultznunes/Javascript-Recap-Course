To make components always have the same height and/or weight, we must use CSS grid instead of 
flexbox. Sometimes we don't need it, but, for instance, when we have a product card where the 
product's description could occupy 1 or 2 lines, we need the grid to make the product's height
still expand if it is only 1 line long.
